# AutismSpectrumDisorderDetection

This project aims to detect Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using preprocessed data from the ABIDE dataset. The process involves extracting features relevant to ASD detection, training Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models of the MobileNet architecture, and evaluating their performance using standard metrics.

## Project Details

- **Frontend:** Tkinter
- **Language:** Python
- **IDE Preferred:** Visual Studio Code
- **OS:** Microsoft Windows 7/8/10, Linux

## Technologies Used

- **MobileNet Architecture (22 Layers):** The project utilizes the MobileNet architecture with 22 layers for efficient feature extraction.

- **Python (Version 3.8):** The programming language used for implementing the project.

- **TKinter:** The frontend of the application is built using TKinter for creating a graphical user interface.

- **Google Colab:** Google Colab is used for collaborative development and accessing GPU resources for model training.

- **NumPy:** NumPy is employed for numerical operations and array manipulation in Python.

- **Matplotlib:** Matplotlib is used for creating visualizations, such as training and validation accuracy graphs.

- **TensorFlow (Version 2.5):** TensorFlow is a powerful machine learning library used for building and training neural network models.

- **Keras (Version 2.4):** Keras is an open-source neural network library that serves as a high-level API for TensorFlow.

- **Pandas:** Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis in Python.

- **Sigmoid Activation Function:** The Sigmoid activation function is employed in certain layers of the neural network model.
